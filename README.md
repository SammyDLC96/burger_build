# burger_build
I'm a beginner in Python and thought it would be a good entry level code to create a burger builder and then have the total displayed.
I would like some help. For context, I have created different functions which will take the user's input and assign it a price.
The issue is, I cannot get the rest of the 'if statements' to work. How can I go about this?

I am also seeking advice on where I could improve.
